# Techno-Voice_Assistant

## Description
This is a voice-controlled assistant project using Python.  
Created from **26-12-2024 to 29-12-2024**.  
It runs based on Python version **3.12**.

The assistant can perform multiple tasks, including:
- Recognizing and responding to voice commands.
- Playing YouTube videos.
- Opening desktop applications and URLs.
- Telling jokes.
- Taking screenshots.
- Accessing Wikipedia.
- Providing time and date info.


The assistant uses multiple libraries like pyttsx3 for text-to-speech, speech recognition for voice input, and other libraries to control the system, access the internet, and automate tasks.

## Features
- **Text-to-Speech**: Uses pyttsx3 to convert text responses to speech.
- **Voice Recognition**: Recognizes user commands using speech_recognition.
- **Time & Date**: Provides the current date and time.
- **Application Control**: Can open apps like Notepad, Google Chrome, etc.
- **Web Browser**: Opens URLs directly in the default browser.
- **YouTube**: Plays YouTube videos using pywhatkit.
- **Camera Access**: Takes a photo using the system's camera.
- **Screenshot**: Captures the screen using pyautogui.
- **Jokes**: Tells random jokes using pyjokes.
- **Wikipedia**: Searches Wikipedia for information based on voice commands.
- **System Info**: Provides system info and monitors system performance using psutil.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure to install the necessary Python libraries. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd Techno-Voice_Assistant
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the main Python file:

```bash
python voice_assistant.py
```

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the project:

```
pyttsx3
speechrecognition
datetime
os
subprocess
webbrowser
pywhatkit
opencv-python
time
pyautogui
pyjokes
random
wikipedia
requests
psutil
```

You can install all of them using:

```

## Usage

Once you run the assistant, it will wait for a voice command. You can say commands like:

2. **Play [song name] on YouTube**: Plays a specific song or video on YouTube.
3. **What time is it?**: Responds with the current time.
4. **Take a screenshot**: Captures a screenshot and saves it in the project directory.
5. **Tell me a joke**: Responds with a random programmer joke.
6. **Open [app name]**: Opens a specified application (like Notepad, Google Chrome, etc.).
7. **Search Wikipedia for [topic]**: Searches Wikipedia for the given topic and reads out the summary.
8. **Exit**: Ends the assistant program.
and much more give it a run

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Natural Language Processing (NLP):
   - Integrating NLP models to improve the assistant's understanding of complex commands, enabling more accurate and efficient communication with the user.

### 2. Task Automation:
   - Adding more personalized task automation features, such as managing emails, to-do lists, reminders, and calendar events, making the assistant more versatile for daily tasks.

### 3. Cross-Platform Compatibility:
   - Expanding the assistant's compatibility across different operating systems and platforms (e.g., macOS, Linux, and mobile devices) to make it accessible to a wider audience.
